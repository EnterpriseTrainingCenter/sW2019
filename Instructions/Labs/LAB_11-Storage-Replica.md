### Detailed Instructions

#### Task 1: Configure storage

Perform these steps on CL1.

1. Logon as **smart\administrator**
1. Open **Server Manager**.
1. Click **Manage**, **Add servers**.

## Exercise 2: Create a stretched Hyper-V cluster

### Introduction

In this exercise, you will create a stretched Hyper-V cluster and configure storage replica.

### Tasks

1. [Create a failover cluster](#task-1-create-a-failover-cluster)
1. [Configure storage replica](#task-2-configure-storage-replica)

### Detailed Instructions

#### Task 1: Create a failover cluster

Perform these steps on CL1.

1. On SR1 logon as **smart\administrator**
1. Start Windows PowerShell

   ````shell
   powershell
   ````

1. Install a new Failover Cluster. Ignore any warnings.

   ````powershell
   $cluster = 'SR'
   # Variables can store comma-separated lists of values, i. e. arrays
   $node = 'SR1', 'SR2'

   <#
   You can access the first element of an array by addressing it with 0 in
   brackets.
   #>
   $cluster = New-Cluster `
      -Name $clusterName `
      -Node $node[0] `
      -StaticAddress 10.1.1.83 `
      -NoStorage `
      -AdministrativeAccessPoint ActiveDirectoryAndDns
   ````

1. Add SR2 as the second node of the cluster.

   ````powershell
   # The second element in an array has the index number 1
   $cluster | Add-ClusterNode -Name $node[1] -NoStorage
   ````

1. Configure the cluster quorum settings to use a file share witness using \\dhcp\SR-fsw.

   ````powershell
   Set-ClusterQuorum -Cluster $cluster -FileShareWitness '\\Dhcp\SR-fsw'
   ````

1. Configure stretched cluster site awareness using PowerShell. Create two sites: primary and secondary.

   ````powershell
   # Using CIM sessions, you can run commands using the CIM interface remotely
   $cimSession = New-CimSession -ComputerName $node

   New-ClusterFaultDomain -CimSession $cimSession[0] -Name Primary -Type Site
   New-ClusterFaultDomain -CimSession $cimSession[0] -Name Secondary -Type Site
   ````

1. Add the nodes to their sites.

   ````powershell
   Set-ClusterFaultDomain `
      -CimSession $cimSession[0] `
      -Name $node[0] `
      -Parent Primary
   Set-ClusterFaultDomain `
      -CimSession $cimSession[0] `
      -Name $node[1] `
      -Parent Secondary
   ````

1. Set the preferred site to the first domain.

   ````powershell
   <#
   Get-Cluster returns the cluster object. PreferredSite is a property
   of the cluster object, that can be set. To see all properties of an object
   and whether they can be set or are read only, you can use the Get-Member
   cmdlet, e. g.
   $cluster | Get-Member

   Because Get-Cluster must be executed before you can access the properties of
   the returned object, you have to put it into braces.
   #>
   $cluster.PreferredSite = 'Primary'
   ````

1. Set the cluster resiliency period to 10 seconds.

   ````powershell
   $cluster.ResiliencyDefaultPeriod=10
   ````

1. Add all Disks to the cluster.

   ````powershell
   Get-ClusterAvailableDisk -Cluster $cluster -All | Add-ClusterDisk
   ````

1. Configure Kerberos Constrained Delegation to allow SSO from Windows Admin Center.

   ````powershell
   $gw = Get-ADComputer -Identity "srv2"
   Set-ADComputer $clusterName -PrincipalsAllowedToDelegateToAccount $gw 
   ````

#### Task 2: Configure storage replica

Perform these steps on CL1.

1. In the start menu, from **Administrative Tools**, start **Failover Cluster Manager**.
1. In **Failover Cluster Manager**, connect to cluster **SR.smart.etc**.
1. Navigate to **Storage**, **Disks**.
1. From the context menu of the 36GB data disk that is online, select **Add to Cluster Shared Volumes** ([figure 4]).
1. From the context menu of the disk you added to cluster shared volumes, select **Replication**, **Enableâ€¦** ([figure 5]).
1. In the wizard, select the disks as they appear and use the following options for the remaining pages. After the wizard completes, your storage should look similar to [figure 6].
   * **Overwrite destination volumes**
   * **Synchronous replication**
   * **Highest Performance**
1. Select the source disk.
1. At the bottom, activate the tab **Replication**. You should see the initial block copy state ([figure 7]).
1. Take a note of the volume number and the owner node of the source disk ([figure 8]).

## Exercise 3: Test stretched Hyper-V cluster failover

### Introduction

In this exercise, you create a new virtual machine within the Hyper-V stretched cluster. After replication has finished, you shut down one node to simulate a hardware failure. Finally, you test replication failover.
