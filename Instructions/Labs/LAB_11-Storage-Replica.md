## Exercise 2: Create a stretched Hyper-V cluster

### Introduction

In this exercise, you will create a stretched Hyper-V cluster and configure storage replica.

### Tasks

1. [Create a failover cluster](#task-1-create-a-failover-cluster)
1. [Configure storage replica](#task-2-configure-storage-replica)

### Detailed Instructions

#### Task 1: Create a failover cluster

Perform these steps on SR1.

1. On SR1 logon as **smart\administrator**
1. Start Windows PowerShell

   ````shell
   powershell
   ````

1. Install a new Failover Cluster. Ignore any warnings.

   ````powershell
   $cluster = 'SR'
   New-Cluster `
       -Name $cluster `
       -Node SR1 `
       -StaticAddress 10.1.1.83 `
       -NoStorage `
       -AdministrativeAccessPoint ActiveDirectoryAndDns
   ````

1. Add SR2 as the second node of the cluster.

   ````powershell
   Add-ClusterNode -Cluster $cluster -Name SR2 -NoStorage
   ````

1. Configure the cluster quorum settings to use a file share witness using \\dhcp\SR-fsw.

   ````powershell
   Set-ClusterQuorum -Cluster $cluster -FileShareWitness '\\Dhcp\SR-fsw'
   ````

1. Configure stretched cluster site awareness using PowerShell. Create two sites: primary and secondary.

   ````powershell
   New-ClusterFaultDomain -Name Primary -Type Site
   New-ClusterFaultDomain -Name Secondary -Type Site
   ````

1. Add the nodes to their sites.

   ````powershell
   Set-ClusterFaultDomain -Name SR1 -Parent Primary
   Set-ClusterFaultDomain -Name SR2 -Parent Secondary
   ````

1. Set the preferred site to the first domain.

   ````powershell
   <#
   Get-Cluster returns the cluster object. ResiliencyDefaultPeriod is a property
   of the cluster object, that can be set. To see all properties of an object
   and whether they can be set or are read only, you can use the Get-Member
   cmdlet, e. g.
   Get-Cluster | Get-Member

   Because Get-Cluster must be executed before you can access the properties of
   the returned object, you have to put it into braces.
   #>
   (Get-Cluster).PreferredSite = 'Primary'
   ````

1. Set the cluster resiliency period to 10 seconds.

   ````powershell
   (Get-Cluster).ResiliencyDefaultPeriod=10
   ````

1. Add all Disks to the cluster.

   ````powershell
   Get-ClusterAvailableDisk -Cluster $cluster -All | Add-ClusterDisk
   ````

1. Configure Kerberos Constrained Delegation to allow SSO from Windows Admin Center.

   ````powershell
   $gw = Get-ADComputer -Identity "srv2"
   Set-ADComputer $cluster -PrincipalsAllowedToDelegateToAccount $gw 
   ````

#### Task 2: Configure storage replica

Perform these steps on CL1.

1. In the start menu, from **Administrative Tools**, start **Failover Cluster Manager**.
1. In **Failover Cluster Manager**, connect to cluster **SR.smart.etc**.
1. Navigate to **Storage**, **Disks**.
1. From the context menu of the 36GB data disk that is online, select **Add to Cluster Shared Volumes** ([figure 4]).
1. From the context menu of the disk you added to cluster shared volumes, select **Replication**, **Enableâ€¦** ([figure 5]).
1. In the wizard, select the disks as they appear and use the following options for the remaining pages. After the wizard completes, your storage should look similar to [figure 6].
   * **Overwrite destination volumes**
   * **Synchronous replication**
   * **Highest Performance**
1. Select the source disk.
1. At the bottom, activate the tab **Replication**. You should see the initial block copy state ([figure 7]).
1. Take a note of the volume number and the owner node of the source disk ([figure 8]).

## Exercise 3: Test stretched Hyper-V cluster failover

### Introduction

In this exercise, you create a new virtual machine within the Hyper-V stretched cluster. After replication has finished, you shut down one node to simulate a hardware failure. Finally, you test replication failover.

1. [Simulate a workload](#task-2-simulate-a-workload)
1. [Simulate a failure](#task-3-simulate-a-failure)
1. [Validate failover](#task-4-validate-failover)
1. [Simulate recovery](#task-5-simulate-recovery)
1. [Validate recovers](#task-6-validate-recovery)
1. [Reverse replication](task-7-reverse-replication)
1. [Simulate a replication failure](#task-8-simulate-a-replication-failure)

1. In **Windows Admin Center**, add a Failover Cluster Manager connection to **SR.smart.etc**.
1. Connected to **SR.smart.etc**, click on **Virtual Machines**, **Inventory**
1. Create a new VM.
   * **Name**: Nanoserver
   * **Generation**: **2**
   * **Host**: Owner node of the disk you took note of in the previous exercise
   * **Path**: C:\ClusterStorage\VolumeX (where X is the number of the volume you took note in the previous exercise)
   * **Processor Count**: 2
   * **Memory**: 1 GB
   * **Network**: **Datacenter1**
   * **Storage**: **Use existing disk** C:\ClusterStorage\VolumeX\nanoserver.vhdx
1. Select the VM **Nanoserver** and start it

#### Task 2: Simulate a workload

Perform these steps on CL1.

1. Open **Command Prompt**.
1. Ping the virtual server.

   ````shell
   ping -t 10.1.1.25
   ````

1. In Windows Admin Center, connected to SR1.smart.etc click on **Virtual Machines, Inventory**
1. Take note of the node currently owning the VM ([figure 9]).

#### Task 3: Simulate a failure

Perform these steps on the host computer.

1. In **Hyper-V Manager**, turn off the virtual machine you took note of in the previous task.

#### Task 4: Validate failover

Perform these steps on CL1.

1. In **Windows Admin Center**, reconnect to **SR.smart.etc**.
1. Click on **Virtual Machines**, **Inventory**.

   > Is the VM running? On which node?

   > Is the ping command to the virtual machine successful?

1. In **Windows Admin Center**, connect to the SR host, which is still running.
1. Click on **Storage Replica** and check the status ([figure 10]).

#### Task 5: Simulate recovery

Perform these steps on the host computer.

1. In **Hyper-V Manager**, start the failed node.

#### Task 6: Validate recovery

Perform these steps on CL1.

1. In **Windows Admin Center**, check the health-state of the cluster, the disks, the availability of the cluster shared volumes and of storage replication. After a few minutes everything should be back to normal operationsâ€¦

#### Task 7: Reverse replication

Perform these steps on CL1.

1. In **Windows Admin Center**, connect to SR.smart.etc.
1. Click on **Virtual Machines**, **Inventory**
1. Select the VM **NanoServer**.
1. On the toolbar, click on **More**, **Move** ([figure 11]).
1. Move the VM **Nanoserver** back to its original node. Wait for the VM to move back.
1. Connect to the node, where you moved **Nanoserver** to.
1. Navigate to **Storage Replica**.
1. Select the replication partnership
1. On the toolbar, click on **Switch Direction** ([figure 12]). Wait for the switch to complete. The column **Partner group name** should show Replication 2 ([figure 13]).
1. Switch to **Failover Cluster Manager** and navigate to **Storage**, **Disks**. Replication should be in the same state as before we turned off a node.

#### Task 8: Simulate a replication failure

Perform these steps on SR2.

   Mount-SRDestination `
       -ComputerName $computername `
       -Name $name `
       -TemporaryPath D:\ `
       -Force

1. List the contents of the mounted volume. It should be completely identical to the source volume on SR1.

    ````powershell
    Get-ChildItem D:\
    Get-ChildItem C:\ClusterStorage\Volume1
    ````

1. Launch Notepad.

   ````powershell
   notepad
   ````
