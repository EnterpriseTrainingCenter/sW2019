## Exercise 1: Using Windows Admin Center

### Introduction

In this exercise, you will set the default language of Windows Admin Center to English and install the Active Directory extension.  Then, you manually add connections to DC1 and DHCP. Next, you will import connections for HV1 and HV2. Moreover, you will examine how to administer DC1 using Windows Admin Center. Especially, you will try to restart the DNS Server service, retrieve network adapters and their IP settings, filter the application event log for errors and warning, examine storage, and the Windows Update settings.
