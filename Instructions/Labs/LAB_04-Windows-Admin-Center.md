## Exercise 1: Installing and configuring Windows Admin Center

### Introduction

In this exercise, you will install Windows Admin Center on Windows Server 2019 Core Edition using a trusted certificate. After that you will configure Kerberos Constrained Delegation to be able to use Single Sign On (SSO) for Admin Center management.

### Tasks

### Detailed Instructions

#### Task 1: Request a certificate

Perform these steps on SRV2.

1. Logon as **smart\Administrator**
1. Start Windows PowerShell by excuting the following command.

   ````shell
   powershell
   ````

1. Request a certificate and store the result in a variable.

   ````powershell
   # This is an array of strings, separated by commas
   $dnsName = 'admincenter.smart.etc', 'admincenter'
   
   # Expressions in double-quoted strings are indicated by $()
   # [0] is the first element of the string array
   $subjectName = "CN=$($dnsName[0])"
   
   # WebServer10Years is a custom template, we created for you
   $template = 'WebServer10Years'
   
   # The back tick ` can be used to split long command lines and make them more readable
   $result = Get-Certificate `
       -Template $template `
       -SubjectName $subjectName `
       -DnsName $dnsName `
       -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My   
   ````

   ````

1. Execute the following commands to install Windows Admin Center binaries

   ````powershell
   $logPath = 'C:\WAC-install.log'

   # PowerShell variables can be used when executing external commands
   # They are expanded automatically
   msiexec /i $path /qb+ /L*v $logPath CHK_REDIRECT_PORT_80=1 SME_PORT=443 SSL_CERTIFICATE_OPTION=installed SME_THUMBPRINT=$thumbprint
