# smart Windows Server 2019 Compute & Storage Lab Guide

The course and the lab guide are roughly based on official Microsoft course *20740 Installation, Storage, and Compute with Windows Server 2016*. For information about the course see <https://www.etc.at/seminare/sw2019-1/>.

The lab instructions can be found in [**instructions/labs**](https://github.com/EnterpriseTrainingCenter/sW2019-1/tree/main/Instructions/Labs). They are to be used in conjunction with the original presentation slides and virtual machine images only. The slides and virtual machine images are not contained in this repository. Licensing is possible, please contact us.

Branches:

* *main* uses classic GUI tools like MMC consoles and Server Manager, whereever possible.
* *powershell* (work in progress) uses **PowerShell** for the same exercises and tasks, wherever possible.
* *wac* (upcoming) uses **Windows Admin Center**, wherever possible.

If you are a trainer or participant of the course, you may fork this repository. Pull requests are accepted after review.
